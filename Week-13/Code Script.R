Various sources support and highlight factors contributing to this trend, such as a heightened awareness and acceptance of gender fluidity (New York Post, 2018; Metro, 2023) and a push against traditional gender stereotypes that aim to challenge institutionalized sexism and misogyny (Medium, 2023). These rationales reflect a notable shift in societal attitudes, advocating for a more inclusive and progressive mindset. Consequently, more parents are opting for gender-neutral names, intending to impart these progressive values to their children. This trend not only mirrors evolving social attitudes but also sparks essential considerations about our changing society. Recognising its significance, I felt compelled to explore this evolving trend firsthand."),

Interestingly, the proportion of gender-neutral names in the late 1800s was quite high, but the trend declined, reaching its lowest point around the 1960s. It wasnâ€™t until the late 1900s that the trend experienced a resurgence, and has since increased exponentially, more than doubling since the 1800s. This provides testament for the shift in preference of gender-neutral names over the years, which is perhaps reflective of the increased acceptance of gender fluidity as proposed earlier, prompting parents to seek names that transcend traditional gender boundaries."),

However, the proportion has since become more spread out across both sexes, and often more common among female babies, especially during the mid-late 1900s. This shift suggests that parents are increasingly open to the idea of giving their daughters gender-neutral names, challenging the traditional stereotypes that dictate how names should align with gender norms. This shift perhaps reflects a broader societal advancement toward a more egalitarian culture that prioritises gender equality."),

Names lacking explicit femininity tend to have an advantage in scenarios such as job applications, a viewpoint supported by articles in the Guardian (Mahdawi, 2016) and the Wall Street Journal (Greathouse, 2016). This suggests that adopting a gender-neutral name can potentially create more opportunities by concealing one's female identity. In fact, gender-neutral names such as Armani and Finley convey the notion of strength, as they both mean warrior. This association of strength in the meanings of these names not only provides a neutral ground in obscuring gender but also carries connotations of power, echoing the notion that gender-neutral names may project a sense of fortitude and capability in individuals."),
