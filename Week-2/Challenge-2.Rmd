# Exploring music preferences

### A. Background

Imagine that you have been hired as a data analyst by a radio station to analyze music preferences of their DJs. They have provided you with a
dataset, playlist_data.csv , containing information about DJs, their preferred music genres, song titles, and ratings.
Using the data-set you are required to complete some tasks that are listed subsequently. All these tasks are based on the concepts taught in the
video lectures. The questions may not be entirely covered in the lectures; To complete them, you are encouraged to use Google and the
resources therein.

### B.Tasks

Task-1
In the lecture, we used two data-sets, starwars and anscombe's quartet that were readily available with the packages, tidyverse and Tmisc , respectively. When we have to use custom-made data-sets or the ones like we downloaded from Canvas, we have to import it using the R commands before using them. All the questions below are related to this task.

Question 1.1: What does the term “CSV” in playlist_data.csv stand for, and why is it a popular format for storing tabular data?

Solution: **CSV stands for 'Comma Separated Value' and it is popular as it is a simple and universal format that can be easily read and written by many programs and tools.**

Question 1.2: load the tidyverse package to work with .csv files in R.
Solution: install.packages('tidyverse')
# Load the necessary package to work with CSV files in R.
Question 1.3: Import the data-set, playlist_data.csv
Solution:
# Import the "playlist_data.csv" dataset into R
read_csv("playlist_data.csv",eval=TRUE)
Question 1.4: Assign the data-set to a variable, playlist_data
Solution:
# Assign the variable to a dataset
insert_name_of_variable <- read_csv("playlist_data.csv")
From now on, you can use the name of the variable to view the contents of the data-set
Question 1.5: Get more information about read_csv() command and provide a screenshot of the information displayed in the “Help” tab of
the “Files” pane
Solution:
# More information about the R command, complete the code
read_csv()
knitr::include_graphics("name_of_the_file_with_extension")
Question 1.6: What does the skip argument in the read_csv() function do?
Solution: Delete this text and insert your answer here
Question 1.7: Display the contents of the data-set
Solution:
# Type the name of the variable, to see what it contains
Question 1.8: Assume you have a CSV file named sales_data.csv containing information about sales transactions. How would you use the
read_csv() function to import this file into R and store it in a variable named sales_data ?
Solution:
# No output is required for this code
# Only the list of commands that execute the task mentioned in the question are required
Task-2
After learning to import a data-set, let us explore the contents of the data-set through the following questions
Question 2.1: Display the first few rows of the data-set to get an overview of its structure
Solution:
# Type the name of the variable we assigned the data-set to
head(name_of_the_variable)
Question 2.2: Display all the columns of the variable stacked one below another
Solution:
# Stack columns of playlist_data
Question 2.3: How many columns are there in the dataset?
Solution:
# Number of columns
Question 2.4: What is the total count of DJs?
Solution:
# Number of DJs
Question 2.5: Display all the location of all the DJs
Solution:
# Location of DJs
Question 2.6: Display the age of the DJs
Solution:
# Age of DJs
Task-3
Let us plot the data to get more insights about the DJs.
Question 3.1: Create a plot to visualize the relationship between DJs’ ages and their ratings.
Solution:
# complete the code to generate the plot
ggplot(name_of_the_variable)
aes(x=column_name,y=column_name)
Question 3.2: Label the x-axis as “Age” and the y-axis as “Rating.”
Solution:
# complete the code to generate the plot
ggplot(name_of_the_variable)
aes(x=column_name,y=column_name)
Question 3.3: Represent data using points
Solution:
# complete the code to generate the plot
ggplot(name_of_the_variable)
aes(x=column_name,y=column_name)
Question 3.4: Can you change the points represented by dots/small circles to any other shape of your liking?
Solution:
# complete the code to generate the plot
ggplot(name_of_the_variable)
aes(x=column_name,y=column_name)
geom_point( ) # <-- Hint: Use ? to learn more about geom_point and use appropriate values for shape
Question 3.5: Insert a suitable title and briefly provide your insights in the caption
Solution:
# complete the code to generate the plot
ggplot(name_of_the_variable)
aes(x=column_name,y=column_name)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
